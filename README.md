# Digital Twin: Passenger Car Steering System

This project builds a digital twin of a passenger car steering system, including:

✅ Mechanical model (rack-and-pinion + assist motor)  
✅ Control system (torque assist control)  
✅ Simulated input-output data (normal + fault conditions)  
✅ Machine learning analysis for fault detection and optimization

## Folder Structure

- `/models` → Simulink or system models
- `/data` → Simulated datasets (CSV)
- `/ml` → Python notebooks for machine learning analysis

---

**Goals:**
- Predict abnormal steering behavior
- Classify failure modes
- Optimize control strategies using ML
